== Shame ==

Do you find that your dungeon group is taking too much damage during Mythic+ runs? Perhaps you think they could be avoiding the damage their taking? This addon takes a direct approach to this and tracks every single avoidable mistake made by players in your group.

* **How do I use this?** - When in-game, run `/shame start` to begin a shaming session, this will start outputting mistakes that are made. To stop this, run the `/shame stop` command. By default, mistakes will be output to your chat only, to change this behavior use the `/shame mode` command. Finally, to share the results of the current session, make use of the `/shame print` command.

* **Why are you such an elitist?** - This addon is not intended to be a means to prove your amazing skills over other players, rather giving live feedback on avoidable mistakes for groups pushing high dungeon content. Having a mistake called out in chat the instant it happens is more useful to some people than having to dig through combat logs after the fight is over.

* **Something is not tracked that I think should be...** - While I have included most of the avoidable mechanics in the current tier of dungeons, I have likely missed a few things. People are more than welcome to either submit a pull-request with the change/addition, create an issue about it, or send me a message.

* **Which difficulty does this work on?** - While intended for use in Mythic+ dungeons, this will work in any difficulty. I encourage some caution when using this in random groups, especially on the lower difficulties; players running a random heroic probably don't want to hear when they stood in the fire.

* **My language is not (fully/at all) supported?** - I'm unable to localize in to any other language beyond English. If you would like to contribute translations, feel free to submit a pull-request to the GitHub repository, or send me a message about it!
